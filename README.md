# lazzy.py

Generate .swift files of Mappable objects from request or response JSON strings.

# Usage

1. Create a file named "target.json" in the same directory with the script.
2. Paste the JSON you want to convert there.
3. Run the script.
4. Contemplate about the hours of life you wasted typing those thick JSON bodies from before.

# TODO

1. Ask help on how to make this fancier by making it downloadable from the command line. ðŸ¤”
