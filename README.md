# lazzy.py (version 1.0)

Lazzy lets you generate ".swift" files for [ObjectMapper's](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper) "Mappable" from sample json bodies. Supports arrays and nested objects.

# Usage

1. Create a file named "target.json" in the same directory with the script.
2. Paste the JSON you want to convert there.
3. Run the script.

# TODO

1. Ask help on how to make this fancier by making it downloadable from the command line. Are those called packages? ðŸ¤”
2. Add support for arrays with native types / custom objects.
