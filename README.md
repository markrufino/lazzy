# lazzy.py (version 1.0)

Generate .swift files of Mappable objects from request or response JSON strings. Supports arrays and nested objects.

# Usage

1. Create a file named "target.json" in the same directory with the script.
2. Paste the JSON you want to convert there.
3. Run the script.

# TODO

1. Ask help on how to make this fancier by making it downloadable from the command line. Are those called packages? ðŸ¤”
2. Add support for arrays with native types / custom objects.
